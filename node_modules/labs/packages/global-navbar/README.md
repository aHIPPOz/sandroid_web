# global-navbar

This is a Svelte component for the navigation bar that appears across almost all Leaning Technologies websites.

It can also be built with `pnpm build` to produce a hydratable version of the component ready to be used in non-JS apps (such as WordPress sites). The WordPress plugin is available at `wordpress-plugin/global-navbar`.

To develop this component, launch a site such as `sites/labs` and observe the changes there.
