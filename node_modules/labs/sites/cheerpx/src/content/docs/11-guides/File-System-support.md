description: Virtual filesystems and how to use them
---

CheerpX implements UNIX-style virtual filesystems with multiple mount points, providing a flexible and secure way to manage files and data in your web-based Linux environment:

| Filesystem Type | Description                                             | Write | Read |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ----- | ---- |
| WebDevice       | HTTP-based filesystem for loading files from web server | No    | Yes  |
| IDBDevice       | Persistent read-write filesystem using IndexedDB        | Yes   | Yes  |
| DataDevice      | In-memory filesystem for temporary data storage         | Yes   | Yes  |
| HttpBytesDevice | A block device with a Linux filesystem inside (ext2)    | No    | Yes  |
| OverlayDevice   | A writable persistent overlay on another block device   | Yes   | Yes  |

> [!info] Virtual Environment
> CheerpX provides access to a virtualized filesystem environment, which does not correspond to the local user's computer. Direct access to local files is restricted due to browser security constraints.

## WebDevice

WebDevice is a read-only, HTTP-based filesystem in CheerpX. It's primarily used for accessing files from your web server.

### Usage

To create a WebDevice, use the `CheerpX.WebDevice.create()` method:

```js
const webDevice = await CheerpX.WebDevice.create("path/to/local/directory");

const cx = await CheerpX.Linux.create({
	mounts: [ ... , { type: "dir", path: "/web", dev: webDevice }],
});
```

This mounts the specified local directory at `/web` in the CheerpX filesystem.

To be able to list the files, CheerpX will look for a file called index.list in the directory and each of its subdirectories. The file should contain a newline separated list of all files and folders contained in the directory.

### Accessing Files

Files in the WebDevice are accessed relative to the current page's URL. For example, if your current page is `https://host/dir1/dir2/page.html`, then:

- `/web/example.txt` would correspond to `https://host/dir1/dir2/path/to/local/directory/example.txt`
- `/web/images/logo.png` would correspond to `https://host/dir1/dir2/path/to/local/directory/images/logo.png`

> [!note]
> It's important to note that this behavior depends on the current page's URL, as it uses a relative path. For more predictable results, it's recommended to use absolute paths when possible.

## IDBDevice

IDBDevice provides a persistent, read-write filesystem using the browser's IndexedDB. It's ideal for storing data that should persist between sessions.

### Usage

Create an IDBDevice using the `CheerpX.IDBDevice.create()` method:

```javascript
const idbDevice = await CheerpX.IDBDevice.create("dbName");

const cx = await CheerpX.Linux.create({
	mounts: [ ... , { type: "dir", path: "/files", dev: idbDevice }],
});
```

This setup creates a virtual filesystem at `/files` that is backed by IndexedDB.

### Reading Files from JavaScript

You can read files from an `IDBDevice` in JavaScript using the `readFileAsBlob` method:

```javascript
await idbDevice.readFileAsBlob("/filename");
```

### `idbDevice.readFileAsBlob`

`CheerpX.IDBDevice` provides a method to read back files as JavaScript accessible data.

```js
await idbDevice.readFileAsBlob(filename: string): Promise<Blob>
```

**Parameters**:

- **filename**: A string representing the path to the file within the device, starting with a `/` (e.g., "/filename"). Do not include the mount point.

**Returns**:

The method returns a Promise that resolves to a standard JavaScript Blob object.

Example:

```js
const idbDevice = await CheerpX.IDBDevice.create("files");
// Use CheerpX to write something to the device
const outputBlob = await dataDevice.readFileAsBlob("/filename");
```

> [!note] Note
> The `readFileAsBlob` API returns a standard JavaScript Blob object. You can convert it to a string if needed, but you can also convert it to an `ArrayBuffer` or to a URL via `URL.createObjectURL`.

## DataDevice

`DataDevice` is an in-memory filesystem useful for temporary data storage or passing data from JavaScript to the CheerpX environment.

### Usage

Create a DataDevice using the `CheerpX.DataDevice.create()` method:

```javascript
const dataDevice = await CheerpX.DataDevice.create();

const cx = await CheerpX.Linux.create({
	mounts: [ ... , { type: "dir", path: "/data", dev: dataDevice }],
});
```

### Adding Files

You can add files to a DataDevice from JavaScript using the `writeFile` method:

```javascript
await dataDevice.writeFile("/filename", "File content here");
```

### `dataDevice.writeFile`

`CheerpX.DataDevice` provides a method to write data to new files within the mounted device. This utility is limited to creating files at the root level of the device.

```js
await dataDevice.writeFile(filename: string, contents: string | Uint8Array): Promise<void>
```

**Parameters**:

- **filename**: A string representing the path to the file within the device, starting with a `/` (e.g., "/filename"). Do not include the mount point.
- **contents**: The data to write to the file. Can be either a string or a Uint8Array.

**Returns**:

The method returns a Promise that resolves when the file has been created and written to. It doesn't return any value.

Example:

```js
const dataDevice = await CheerpX.DataDevice.create();
await dataDevice.writeFile("/filename", "contents");
```

> [!note]
>
> - This is the only way to create files in this device.
> - Modifying existing files or creating files in subdirectories is not possible.

## Block devices with ext2

CheerpX supports ext2 filesystems, which can be configured as an overlay device. This allows for a flexible setup that can combine different storage types.

### Usage

Create an ext2 filesystem by combining a `HttpBytesDevice` to acess disk blocks, an `IDBDevice` to cache and persist data and a `OverlayDevice` to combine the two.

```javascript
// Create an HttpBytesDevice for streaming disk blocks via HTTP
const httpDevice = await CheerpX.HttpBytesDevice.create(
	"https://yourserver.com/image.ext2",
);

// Create an IDBDevice for persistent local storage
const idbDevice = await CheerpX.IDBDevice.create("block1");

const overlayDevice = await CheerpX.OverlayDevice.create(httpDevice, idbDevice);

const cx = await CheerpX.Linux.create({
	mounts: [{ type: "ext2", path: "/", dev: overlayDevice }],
});
```

This setup creates an ext2 filesystem that loads its initial data from an HTTP source and uses IndexedDB for persistent storage of changes.

### Device Configuration Options

CheerpX supports various types of devices that can be used in the OverlayDevice configuration:

1. **HttpBytesDevice**: The default choice for loading filesystem images via HTTP. Suitable for most web-hosted files.
2. **GitHubDevice**: Ideal for projects forked from the [WebVM](https://github.com/leaningtech/webvm/) repository. The Integrated GitHub Action will take care of preparing disk chunks for efficient access.
3. **OverlayDevice**: `OverlayDevice` supports chaining, making it possible to efficiently "fork" disk images while only storing the changes from previous versions.

## Best Practices

1. Use WebDevice for read-only access to server-side files.
2. Utilize IDBDevice for persistent storage of user data or application state.
3. Employ DataDevice for temporary storage or passing data between JavaScript and CheerpX.
4. Consider ext2 filesystems for more complex file operations or when you need a traditional Linux filesystem structure.

By leveraging these different filesystem types, you can create a flexible and efficient file management system within your CheerpX-powered web application.
