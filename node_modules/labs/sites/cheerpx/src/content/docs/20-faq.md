## How can I capture stdout from a program running in CheerpX?

Currently, CheerpX doesn't directly support capturing stdout from running programs. However, there's a workaround that allows you to capture the output, albeit with some limitations.

### Workaround: Redirecting to a File

You can redirect the output of a program to a file and then read that file from JavaScript. Here's how:

1. Make sure to mount an IDBDevice for a writable and JavaScript-accessible file storage

```js
const filesDevice = await CheerpX.IDBDevice.create("files");
const cx = await CheerpX.Linux.create({
	mounts: [
		// This example assumes using `overlayDevice` as the root, please adapt accordingly to your needs
		{ type: "ext2", path: "/", dev: overlayDevice },
		{ type: "dir", path: "/files", dev: filesDevice },
	],
});
```

2. Run your program using `bash -c`, redirecting stdout to a file:

```js
await cx.run("/bin/bash", [
	"-c",
	"echo 'Output to capture' > /files/output.txt",
]);
```

3. After the program finishes, read the contents of the file using JavaScript:

```javascript
const outputBlob = await filesDevice.readFileAsBlob("/output.txt");
console.log(await outputBlob.text());
```

### Limitation

This method has a significant limitation: it doesn't provide streaming output. The entire program needs to finish execution before you can read the output file. This means you won't see real-time output, and for long-running programs, you'll have to wait until completion to see any results.

## Why can't CheerpX find files in my `WebDevice` backend?

We know from experience that the interaction between mount points and `WebDevice` can be confusing for some users. The best solution to identify why a file can't be found is to use the _**Network**_ tab to see the final URLs that CheerpX is trying to access. With this information you should be able to fix the incorrect paths.

### Debugging Path Issues

Use browser's DevTools:

1. Open DevTools (F12 or right-click and "Inspect").
2. Go to "Network" tab.
3. Filter for your application's requests.
4. Look for 404 (Not Found) errors.
5. Check the full URL of these 404 requests to see the exact path CheerpX is trying to access.

## Can I use third-party origins with `WebDevice`?

Yes, `WebDevice` can handle third-party origins as paths, but it's important to consider the implications of Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) when doing so. To ensure smooth functioning, the server hosting these third-party resources must have the appropriate CORS headers configured. If the CORS settings are not properly arranged, browsers will block these requests, which will lead to files being inaccessible in CheerpX.

## Why can't I execute files directly from a `DataDevice`?

`DataDevice` in CheerpX does not have full support for Linux mode bits, and in particular it lacks the _**executable**_ bit. This means you can read data from it, but you cannot execute files directly from it. To execute files that are in a DataDevice, you need to first copy the files to a filesystem with complete support for mode bits, such as `IDBDevice` (IndexedDB) or Ext2.

## Why can't CheerpX do what v86 does in terms of disk access and networking?

CheerpX's architecture and use case differ significantly from v86, which affects how it handles disk access and networking:

### Disk Access

CheerpX is designed to support large scale applications and complete Operating Systems, to achieve those objectives it needs to handle large disk images (up to 2GB at the time). This means we cannot simply download the entire disk image before starting execution, as v86 might do for its smaller images. Instead, CheerpX uses a chunk-based, on-demand downloading system.

Our cloud disk backend is based on WebSocket and distributed across a global CDN, which should provides low latency disk access to users everywhere in the world. We are aware that some users in mainland China might experience slower disk access at the moment due to local networking constraints.

### Networking

While v86 might use an open proxy to the internet, this approach is not feasible for CheerpX due to its scale of use. An open proxy can pose significant security and abuse risks when used at scale.

Instead, CheerpX supports Tailscale-based networking, which can accommodate many use cases. It's important to note that developers using CheerpX are responsible for implementing appropriate security measures and preventing potential abuse.
