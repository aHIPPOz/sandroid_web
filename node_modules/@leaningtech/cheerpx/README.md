## What is CheerpX?

CheerpX is a powerful X86 virtualization library designed to run unmodified binary applications and libraries in the browser. It leverages a WebAssembly-based sandbox and standard browser APIs to ensure security, even when executing untrusted code. CheerpX supports Linux-compatible system calls and can run many common applications, including complete Linux distributions.

CheerpX features an advanced Just-In-Time compiler that dynamically translates X86 code to WebAssembly as needed. This engine is highly robust, capable of handling dynamically generated and self-modifying code.

To see CheerpX in action, visit [WebVM](https://webvm.io) for shell access to a complete Debian machine running in the browser.

## Limitations

 * Currently, only 32-bit x86 binaries are supported. Future updates will include support for 64-bit binaries and other architectures.
 * 3D accelerated graphics are not yet supported.

## Licensing

CheerpX is proprietary software and it's free to use only for personal and open-source projects. Commercial support, feature fast tracking, sponsored development and consulting packages are available for Enterprise customers.
